*[Data source](https://github.com/Shan-Mi/marvel-api-react-task1)*

### tools, etc:
- React
- React-router-dom
- styled-components
- eslint
- prettier
- heroku

### TODO
1. Get rid of the stupid forceRefresh thing;
2. Should implement useContext and lazy and other stuff to get the whole thing improved;
3. Using customized hook to fetch data multiple times which is stupid and low effecient, need a store to store data, filter, etc. Will come back from later course, so sure. 

PS. *If it's a real offcial API, there will be huge amount of data, then condition check, data filtering, even server render and other render optimization, wanna die...*
